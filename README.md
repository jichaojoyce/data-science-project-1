## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose 2017 Stack Overflow survey data dataset. 

I myself, as a woman from Asia and plan to start my career in the field of data science. I have several questions in my mind based on the Stack Overflow survey data as follow. 

1. Does woman make less money than man?
2. Does woman satisfy job as man?
3. Which contury offered woman high salary?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

survey-results-public.csv contains the parameters such as salary, gender, race, satification, and years of coding experience. 

There is also a Jupyter notebook here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main finding is that the IT works need more women! In 2017, ~60% men working as a programmer compared with only ~0.6% women. America offered women the highest salary! Salary for the first 15 years' career is quite equal. But after 15 years, man's salary is higher than woman. Men feels more statisfied with their job and career compared with women. 

More detailed discussion can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
